In this project we emphasized the importance of the flexbox properties, but
also put in perspective the width importance across reference of flex containers
to their respective flex items. Notes are heavily inputted in the styles.css file.

We also incorporated the importance of using the viewport.

The rest of the code is self-explanatory. Please refer to the files of index.html
and styles.css.

We also made this website responsive by changing the appearance of the webpage when
the screen size changes.
